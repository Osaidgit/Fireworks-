ðŸŽ† Rainbow Fireworks Show (Python, Pygame)
Description:
Designed and developed an interactive fireworks simulation using Python and Pygame. This project demonstrates basic particle physics, OOP principles, and real-time graphics rendering.

When the user clicks anywhere on the screen, a firework launches from that position, ascends to a random explosion height, and bursts into 100 colorful particles. Each particle moves outward at a random angle and speed, simulating a realistic explosion effect. Gravity is applied to each particle to create a natural falling motion.

The project features:

Object-Oriented Design: Each firework is an instance of the Firework class, managing its own launch, explosion, and particle system.

Particle System: Particles are generated with random trajectories, creating vibrant rainbow-colored fireworks.

User Interaction: Users can launch multiple fireworks simultaneously by clicking different points on the screen.

Performance Management: Exploded fireworks are removed once all particles fall off-screen to maintain smooth performance.

This self-built simulation strengthened my understanding of 2D game loops, basic physics simulation, event handling, and Pygame graphics rendering. It reflects my passion for building creative, visually engaging Python applications to upskill myself and experiment with real-time simulations.
